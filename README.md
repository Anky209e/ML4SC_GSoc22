### GSOC22 evaluation results
# **Exploring** **transformers**
## Datset Used:
#### I used the dataset provided by deepmind on their test document.It contains two types of images one with substructure and one with no substructure.I #### divided the data into two categories Test and Train by 10:90.Here is the imageof data.
